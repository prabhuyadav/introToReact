JSX - format of writing direct html code in to js files using React. React uses a advanced compiler named Babel which will recognie this html code and compiles it into it's javascript equivalent
as this is a js file that our browser will finally read, so that our browser can understand

We can use that latest syntax import instead of assigning as variables to import react modules.

Inside the render function it can only take one html element so if we want a h1 and a paragraph then
we simply enclose it in a div which will be considered as a single element and this div will be
created inside our root div with id root which we gave as second arg to the render fn.

Next....

we can use curly braces {} to include javascript code inside our html code used in the render function.
so this is the format in JSX file.

in index.html when we are including the script we need to change the type to JSX instead of javascript to not get some non blocking errors.

Adding attributes to the html in jsx code i.e index.js  is different that adding normal html attr.

we need to add JSX attr which are camel cased version of corresponding html attr in most cases and this is because since this will be compiled and converted to javascript instead of html we need 
to add these JSX attrs so that DOM can recognize these names.for example className is the actual dom property that we set when we set a class for an element in the html so we set that property directly here
which itself is the JSX attr name and it will be like that in most cases.

Adding inline styles. becomes useful when we wanna update style dynamically. so in JSX we need to give a js object with css properties as keys and the corresponing values as strings.
similar to html attr being camelCased version in JSX we need to camelCase the css properties also instead of kebab case. for example font-size is fontSize in jsx.
