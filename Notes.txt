JSX - format of writing direct html code in to js files using React. React uses a advanced compiler named Babel which will recognie this html code and compiles it into it's javascript equivalent
as this is a js file that our browser will finally read, so that our browser can understand

We can use that latest syntax import instead of assigning as variables to import react modules.

Inside the render function it can only take one html element so if we want a h1 and a paragraph then
we simply enclose it in a div which will be considered as a single element and this div will be
created inside our root div with id root which we gave as second arg to the render fn.
